                Geotab is a global leader in telematics and connected transportation. Headquartered in Oakville, Ontario, Geotab helps businesses manage their fleets using 
                smart data—from tracking vehicle locations in real time to analyzing things like driver behavior and fuel efficiency.vWhat makes Geotab stand out is its open 
                platform, which allows companies to plug in different tools and customize their fleet management solutions. With over 3 million connected vehicles around the world, 
                the company is constantly working with massive amounts of data to help businesses make better, safer, and more sustainable decisions. One of the coolest things about 
                working at Geotab is how deeply they care about innovation, data security, and real-world impact. Whether it's improving road safety or reducing carbon footprints, 
                the work being done here is making a difference and it was exciting to be a small part of that during my term.

                Product Team at Geotab plays a central role in shaping the tools and systems used across the company and by its partners. The team is made up of product managers, 
                coordinators, designers, and developers who collaborate closely to build and improve internal platforms. One of the main systems I got to work with was MyAdmin which is 
                Geotab's internal portal used by resellers and support teams to manage customer accounts, devices, orders, and more. It's a powerful tool that supports a wide range of 
                day-to-day operations, and being involved in maintaining and enhancing it gave me a great look into how product teams balance user needs, business goals, and technical 
                constraints. It was also a great chance to see how feedback loops and cross-functional collaboration shape the evolution of a product over time.

            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                As a Product Coordinator Intern at Geotab, I had the opportunity to contribute to the Product Team in a hands-on and meaningful way. A major part of 
                my work focused on supporting the MyAdmin system, Geotab’s internal portal for managing devices, customer accounts, and operational tools. One of my 
                most impactful contributions was building an automation solution to streamline the MyAdmin Solutions Request process. Previously manual and time-consuming, 
                this workflow allowed our team to more efficiently collect, prioritize, and route incoming feature and support requests. Automating parts of this process not 
                only saved time but also improved consistency and visibility across teams.

                Another exciting project I worked on involved the use of AI to generate first-draft content for product announcement blogs. By pulling structured data 
                from Jira tickets—like feature summaries, use cases, and release notes, I used Gemini API that produced blog post drafts for the technical writing team. 
                This helped reduce the time spent drafting announcements and gave writers a strong starting point to build from. It was a fun mix of product knowledge, 
                content strategy, and experimentation with AI tools.
            </p>

            <p> 
                This internship has been a huge growth experience for me, both technically and professionally. I improved my project coordination and communication skills by 
                working closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, product managers, and technical writers. Having the chance to explore the practical 
                use of AI in content generationreally pushed me to think creatively about how emerging technologies can improve everyday workflows. 

                One of the biggest learning opportunities came early in the term when I was trusted to take on a major feature project from the ground up. I coordinated with multiple 
                stakeholders across product, engineering, and support to gather context, define goals, and kick off the initiative. Leading those initial conversations taught me a lot 
                about stakeholder alignment, project scoping, and setting expectations which are skills that are essential in any product role.

                What really helped me succeed in this role were the concepts I learned in courses like Software Engineering and Software Analysis & Design. These classes gave me a strong 
                foundation in writing user stories, defining acceptance criteria, and understanding the product lifecycle. I was able to apply these skills daily when supporting feature 
                development and documenting new releases. Through it all, I further improved critical soft skills like clear communication, time management, and problem-solving in a 
                fast-paced environment. This internship really showed me how to apply academic knowledge, adapt it, and grow from it.

                    I'm proud to have achieved this goal by leading projects like the MyAdmin Solutions Requests Automation. Early on, I noticed that the Solutions Request process 
                    was very manual, time-consuming, and often led to important requests being missed or delayed. I quickly saw an opportunity to automate it, which became a key 
                    focus of my work. I took charge of automating the process by first figuring out where things were slowing down, then working with the team to design a system 
                    that could automatically sort, prioritize, and track requests. I also created a dashboard that showed the status of all requests in real-time, making it easier 
                    for everyone to see what was happening and stay on top of things. Since we launched the automation, the team has really appreciated how much faster and more 
                    organized everything is. Requests that used to slip through the cracks are now being handled quickly. Even the VP has praised the improvement, recognizing the 
                    positive impact it's had on our workflow. The feedback I received from my team and manager showed that I was able to lead the project well and create a solution 
                    that really made a difference. This experience has boosted my confidence in managing projects and leading change while also teaching me how to work with cross-functional teams.

                    A key project I worked on involved Unleash Feature Flags. I created webhooks through Unleash to better manage feature flags so that they are properly deprecated in a timely manner. 
                    This helped improve the management of product features by making it easier to control which features were active and when they should be removed across multiple environments. 
                    I also worked with the Gemini AI API to integrate with Jira Cloud Automation. By doing this, I automated the process of writing content for the technical content solutions team, 
                    saving them significant time. This API integration allowed us to auto-generate content based on predefined templates which streamlines the feature documentation process and making 
                    it a lot more efficient. In addition to these projects, I completed a certification on Workato and working through various modules which further enhanced my ability to automate 
                    processes and integrate various systems. Overall, this experience has definitely improved my technical capabilities, particularly in automating tasks and managing complex systems and 
                    allowed me to implement solutions that have had a positive impact on team I helped.

                    I noticed a recurring issue in a workflow during my time here. When stakeholders create tickets for new roles or permissions, they weren't following the correct format or naming convention we had established. 
                    This inconsistency created confusion and slowed down the process. To solve this, I implemented a simple solution which was to I automate the process so that whenever someone created a ticket for a new role or 
                    permission, the description would automatically update to include the correct role naming convention template. This ensured that all tickets followed the same format, making the workflow more consistent across 
                    the platform. Through this experience, I was able to improve the consistency and efficiency of the workflow which has saved a lot of time and reduced errors. The feedback from the team highlighted how much easier 
                    it has become to manage these tasks with the new simple system in place.

                <p>
                    When I set this goal, I aimed to gain a deep technical understanding of telematics and connected car solutions. However, I realized that I didn't have a full picture of the type of work I'd be doing as a Product Coordinator. 
                    As a result, my direct exposure to technical aspects of telematics and connected vehicles was more limited than I had initially anticipated. That said, I still gained a good understanding of this through the work I was involved in. 
                    While I didn't dive deeply into embedded systems or vehicle integration at a technical level, I learned how telematics products are managed, how product teams operate and how customer needs are translated into product features. 
                    I took time to understand Geotab's offerings, including the GO device, MyGeotab and MyAdmin platforms, and how they deliver value to fleets through data insights. I'm glad that I still developed a broader awareness of how telematics 
                    fits into the overall product lifecycle and gained clarity on which areas of the automotive tech industry I'd like to explore further.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                My internship at Geotab as a Product Coordinator Intern has really been rewarding experience so far and has allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in real-world settings, take ownership of impactful projects, and grow both personally 
                and professionally. From leading the early development of a key feature in MyAdmin to experimenting with automation and AI-driven content creation, I was able to contribute meaningfully to the Product Team while continuously learning along 
                the way. This work term deepened my understanding of the product lifecycle, strengthened my ability to collaborate across diverse teams, and gave me confidence in navigating ambiguity and complex problem-solving. It also confirmed my passion for 
                product management and I gained a stronger interest in the intersection of technology, user experience, and business strategy while working within the automotive sector.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have had the chance and freedom to learn new technologies and strengthen my skills with those I was already familiar with. Although some of the tools and frameworks I have used was new to me, I ramped myself up 
                and continued to push the scope of my work. If asked to describe the contents of my co-op work term, I would highlight my involvement in impactful product initiatives at Geotab—ranging from leading the development 
                of new MyAdmin features to automating internal processes and leveraging AI for content generation. My website showcases the hands-on experience I gained, the skills I developed, and the real-world impact I was able 
                to make as a Product Coordinator Intern. Looking forward to the next 4 months!

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                A big thank you to Filip, my manager, for trusting me with meaningful work right from the start and always encouraging me to take initiative. I also want to shoutout Glenn, my mentor, who is always there to answer questions, 
                offer feedback, and help me grow throughout the term. Their support made a huge difference in my experience, and I really appreciated the chance to learn from both of them.
            <br>  
            <br> 
                I would also like to thank Laura Gatto, Kate McRoberts, and Anne-Marie Zawadzki, my Co-op Coordinators at the University of Guelph, for their invaluable feedback during the co-op application process
                and their patient guidance in addressing my work-term inquiries. A special thank you to my Academic Advisor Greg Klotz for taking the time to read my work term report. I appreciate the 
                amount of time it takes to read through students co-op reports.
            <br>   
            <br>
                I’d also like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Geotab and the Campus Community Team for creating such a welcoming and growth-focused environment for interns. From day one, I felt like a valued part of the team and the culture made this unforgettable experience, 
                and I’m incredibly grateful to have been part of it.
            </p>
