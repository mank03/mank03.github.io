                Vehicle Connected Services is a rapidly growing field within the automotive industry that leverages computer science and technology 
                to provide innovative and enhanced experiences for vehicle owners. Since modern vehicles are equipped with sophisticated infotainment 
                and connectivity systems, creating user-friendly interfaces, integrating smartphone connectivity, and ensuring seamless communication 
                between vehicles and external systems is crucial. 
              <br>  
              <br>  
                Joining the team at Nissan has been a remarkable chapter in my co-op journey. As a global leader in the automotive industry, 
                Nissan's reputation for innovation, quality, and commitment to sustainability with their lineup of EV's has been evident from day one.

            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                As a Vehicle Connected Services Co-op at Nissan Canada Inc., my role was centered around actively participating in the development and 
                testing of mobile apps and web portals. Working closely with a dedicated team, I had the exciting opportunity to contribute to the 
                creation of innovative solutions that enhance the connectivity and experience of Nissan and INFINITI vehicle owners. My responsibilities also 
                included collaborating on app features, engaging in telematics testing procedures to ensure app functionality and improving current VCS processes
                using automation. 
            </p>

            <p> One of the unique aspects of my job was the opportunity to be hands-on with the vehicles themselves and directly engage in testing the 
                functionality of in-vehicle features and mobile apps. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between software development and real-world automotive
                technology. My SQL skills were important, as it enabled me to interact with databases, extract valuable insights, and ensure efficient 
                data management. Proficiency in utilizing JIRA was essential for reporting issues, tracking progress of bug fixes, and validating them. 
                Collaboration was also key, as I actively participated in cross-functional teams, collaborating with developers, designers, and 
                marketing teams to achieve our shared objectives. My ability to contribute effectively in team settings and communicate technical 
                concepts clearly was pivotal in driving project success. Although I have learned these skills in class and from previous experiences,
                this role enabled me to leverage these for real-world applications. This combination of these skills was important in not only fulfilling 
                the requirements of the role but also in (literally) driving innovation for Vehicle Connected Services at Nissan Canada.

            <h2>Learning Goals & Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                I am thrilled to reflect on successfully acheving the learning goals I had set for this term. My goals were closed tied to my job tasks and 
                developed them based on the positive feedback and my performance from the previous term. Through collaborative efforts with cross-functional teams,
                use of technological tools, and acheiving more proficiency in my workflow, thses efforts have allowed me to broaden my skill set and meet those objectives. 
                The knowledge and expertise I have gained, particularly in app development, vehicle connected technology, and automotive business operations, have not only
                enhanced my current role but will also certainly prove invaluable in my future automotive work experiences.

                    Throughout the term, I contributed to the development and launch of U of G webpages for the new Research Ethics Online System (EthOS). I was actively 
                    involved in hands-on tasks, especially during the testing phases, applying what I learned with guidance from developers. I took the initiative to 
                    document project progress, milestones, and challenges, and regularly updated my team and the Research Ethics Office. This experience helped me improve 
                    my web development skills and project management abilities. I aim to take on more responsibilities in future projects to build on the knowledge and 
                    experience I gained during this co-op term.

                     My managers gave very positive feedback, especially on the quality and efficiency of my work. I learned the value of continuous learning and adapting to new 
                     technologies, which I believe will be a solid foundation for my future work.

                    Enhancing my technological literacy has significantly elevated the quality of my work, through accuracy, thoroughness, and timeliness. My team members have seen a notable improvement 
                    in task completion as I was able to implement advanced Excel operations in the VCS Availability Sheet using automation code, developing code with IF-ELSE statements, etc. Due to these technical enhancements during the internship, 
                    the VCS processes have been substantially optimized compared to before I joined. These improvements have streamlined the use of frameworks and documentations for the entire team and facilitate the next intern's work so it can allow 
                    them to complete their tasks more effectively as well. Additionally, tasks that were previously expected by end-of-day were now consistently accomplished earlier, reflecting my increased efficiency and time management. 
                    My improvement in technological literacy has also allowed for a more proactive approach to completing assignments that has positively impacted the overall workflow and productivity for the entire team.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The conclusion of this internship at Nissan marks the end of an incredible chapter! As my internship at Nissan Canada came to a close, I am extremely grateful for the amazing experience these past 8 months have been. 
                From learning about connected car systems to being part of such an incredible team, it has truly been an awesome journey. I've had the opportunity to dive into various impactful projects, work alongside some of the most 
                talented minds, and gain insights into so much knowledge that I can carry forward in my career.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have had the chance and freedom to learn new technologies and strengthen my skills with those I was already familiar with. Although some of the tools and frameworks I have used was new to me, I ramped myself up 
                and continued to push the scope of my work. If asked to describe the contents of my co-op work term, I see my audience emphasizing the hands-on experience gained in 
                mobile app development process and telematics testing procedures, the practical insights into connected car and vehicle connected services, and effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams to 
                acheive my learning outcomes. Looking forward to the next chapter and am excited to make further contributions to the automotive industry! 🚗

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to sincerely thank my VCS Coordinator Roma Bogaczewicz and VCS Development Manager Preston Wong for continuing to encourage me, guide me, and for giving me the opportunity to join the team.
                They have made each day of this internship extremely valuable and has made this experience even more rewarding. Thank you to all team members and fellow colleagues 
                I met along the way who supported me and took an interest in my work!
            <br>  
            <br> 
                I would also like to thank Laura Gatto and Kate McRoberts, my Co-op Coordinators at the University of Guelph, for their invaluable feedback during the co-op application period
                and their patient guidance in addressing my work-term inquiries. A special thank you to my Academic Advisor Greg Klotz for taking the time to read my work term report. I appreciate the 
                amount of time it takes to read through students co-op reports.
            <br>   
            <br>
                I also want to acknowledge that Nissan Canada has been an amazing work environment. The entire team's openness and accessibility have fostered a collaborative 
                atmosphere. The dedication to innovation makes Nissan a truly Great Place To Work! 🙌
