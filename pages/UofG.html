            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                As a Designer & Developer Co-op at University of Guelph, I was involved in the design and development of the EthOS Hub, a significant initiative 
                aimed at streamlining the university‚Äôs research ethics application process. I led the design efforts, ensuring that the platform was intuitive, 
                user-friendly, and aligned with the university‚Äôs branding. This involved creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes that communicated my design 
                ideas to stakeholders, which was an incredibly rewarding process. Seeing the project come to life and knowing that my work directly contributed to 
                improving the research community‚Äôs experience was a highlight of my term.

                I also dove into web development tasks, where I applied my skills in HTML, CSS, and other web technologies to build and maintain digital platforms. 
                I made sure that the solutions I developed were not only functional but also optimized for performance and accessibility. This hands-on experience 
                allowed me to sharpen my technical abilities while also understanding the importance of creating inclusive and efficient web applications.

            </p>

            <p> A major learning opportunity came when I developed automated reporting dashboards using Power BI. Initially, this was a daunting task, but I embraced 
                the challenge and turned it into a success. The dashboards I created provided valuable insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and user adoption, 
                which were critical for decision-making within the project. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of 
                data-driven decision-making.

                Collaboration was a big part of my experience. I worked closely with project managers, developers, and other team members, contributing to regular meetings and 
                problem-solving discussions. This taught me the value of teamwork and how different perspectives can lead to better solutions. Looking back, I‚Äôm proud of how I 
                was able to identify opportunities to improve the quality of work and the level of service we provided. I proactively sought feedback and continuously looked for 
                ways to enhance our design and development processes. This mindset has helped me deliver better work but also made me a more valuable member of the team.

            <p>
                I am thrilled to reflect on successfully acheving the learning goals I had set for this term. 
                I focused on improving my technical skills, make meaningful contributions to key projects, and effective collaboration with all levels of stakeholders. 
                My primary learning goals were to develop expertise in UI/UX design and project management by leading the implementation of EthOS and to refine my data 
                analytics capabilities through the creation of automated reporting dashboards. 
                These objectives helped me apply what I‚Äôve learned in university to real-world problems, manage resources effectively, and positively influence my team,
                setting the stage for ongoing learning and growth.

                    involved in hands-on tasks, especially during the testing phases, applying what I learned with guidance from developers. I took the initiative to 
                    document project progress, milestones, and challenges, and regularly updated my team and the Research Ethics Office. This experience helped me improve 
                    my web development skills and project management abilities. I aim to take on more responsibilities in future projects to build on the knowledge and 
                    experience I gained during this co-op term.

                    By the end of the term, I successfully created various graphic designs, logos, and UI/UX prototypes that met project requirements and exceeded stakeholder expectations. My work on designs for EthOS 
                    showed a solid grasp of design principles and the ability to turn them into innovative, user-friendly designs. The process of designing, testing, and refining helped me deeply understand user needs 
                    and how to meet them. The positive feedback I received encouraged me to think creatively and keep improving my work. The creativity and critical thinking skills I developed during this co-op will be 
                    crucial in my future roles, and I look forward to tackling more complex design challenges.

                    This goal was key to helping me contribute to improving the user experience for researchers at the University of Guelph. I engaged with e-learning design by attending workshops, 
                    joining meetings, and studying user guides from Infonetica software. My technical support efforts led to measurable improvements, including a noticeable reduction in support tickets 
                    through the RAIMSsupport email. I realized that effective support isn't just about fixing issues but also about anticipating user needs and enhancing the overall experience. I'm eager 
                    to keep refining my skills in designing and developing systems like this, with a focus on further improving user experiences.

            <p>
                The conclusion of my Co-op work term at the University of Guelph marks the end of an incredibly rewarding chapter! I am extremely grateful for the invaluable experience I‚Äôve had over these past months.
                From contributing to the implementation of the EthOS system to being part of such a dedicated team, this journey has been truly amazing. I‚Äôve had the chance to tackle impactful projects, collaborate 
                with talented professionals, and gain insights that will undoubtedly benefit my future career. This experience has deepened my understanding and provided me with skills and knowledge that I will carry forward 
                with great enthusiasm.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have had the chance and freedom to learn new technologies and strengthen my skills with those I was already familiar with. Although some of the tools and frameworks I have used was new to me, I ramped myself up 
                and continued to push the scope of my work. If asked to describe the contents of my co-op work term, I would highlight my involvement in developing the Research Ethics Online System (EthOS), where I focused on 
                UI/UX design and project management. I also created automated reporting dashboards to provide key insights and improve data analysis. Throughout the term, I worked on real-world projects that allowed me to apply my 
                academic knowledge, solve practical problems, and collaborate effectively with a dedicated team to acheive my learning outcomes. Looking forward to the next chapter!

                I would also like to thank Laura Gatto, Kate McRoberts, and Anne-Marie Zawadzki, my Co-op Coordinators at the University of Guelph, for their invaluable feedback during the co-op application process
                and their patient guidance in addressing my work-term inquiries. A special thank you to my Academic Advisor Greg Klotz for taking the time to read my work term report. I appreciate the 
                amount of time it takes to read through students co-op reports.
            <br>   
            <br>
                I also want to acknowledge that University of Guelph for providing an opportunity to be part of such impactful projects and creating an environment where I could apply my skills and learn from some of the best in the field.
                The institution truly lives up to its commitment to "Improve Life" ! üôå
