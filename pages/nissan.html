            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                As a Vehicle Connected Services Co-op at Nissan Canada Inc., my role was centered around actively participating in the development and 
                testing of mobile apps and web portals. Working closely with a dedicated team, I had the exciting opportunity to contribute to the 
                creation of innovative solutions that enhance the connectivity and experience of Nissan and INFINITI vehicle owners. My responsibilities also 
                included collaborating on app features, engaging in telematics testing procedures to ensure app functionality and improving current VCS processes
                using automation. 
            </p>

            <p> One of the unique aspects of my job was the opportunity to be hands-on with the vehicles themselves and directly engage in testing the 
                functionality of in-vehicle features and mobile apps. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between software development and real-world automotive
                technology. My SQL skills were important, as it enabled me to interact with databases, extract valuable insights, and ensure efficient 
                data management. Proficiency in utilizing JIRA was essential for reporting issues, tracking progress of bug fixes, and validating them. 
                Collaboration was also key, as I actively participated in cross-functional teams, collaborating with developers, designers, and 
                marketing teams to achieve our shared objectives. My ability to contribute effectively in team settings and communicate technical 
                concepts clearly was pivotal in driving project success. Although I have learned these skills in class and from previous experiences,
                this role enabled me to leverage these for real-world applications. This combination of these skills was important in not only fulfilling 
                the requirements of the role but also in (literally) driving innovation for Vehicle Connected Services at Nissan Canada.

            <h2>Learning Goals & Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                I am thrilled to reflect on successfully acheving the learning goals I had set for this term. My goals were closed tied to my job tasks and 
                developed them based on the positive feedback and my performance from the previous term. Through collaborative efforts with cross-functional teams,
                use of technological tools, and acheiving more proficiency in my workflow, thses efforts have allowed me to broaden my skill set and meet those objectives. 
                The knowledge and expertise I have gained, particularly in app development, vehicle connected technology, and automotive business operations, have not only

                    I led the EV Day presentation at the Vehicle Connected Services booth, collaborating alongside my coordinator Roma. All the positive feedback from colleagues, managers, 
                    and event attendees acknowledging the success of the booth and communicating the information, was incredibly rewarding. Additionally, I actively participated in 
                    volunteering opportunities, showcasing vehicles for the training team in collaboration with the Marketing Department, among other intiatives. These experiences allowed me to demonstrate and 
                    further refine my oral communication skills, creating a clearer and more engaging interaction within cross-functional teams and events in the future.

                <p>
                    Despite an increase in workload, I maintained consistent standards by completing assignments with the same level of quality. For example, utilizing Tableau and engaging in discussions 
                    with the IS team allowed me to make informed decisions and provide solid recommendations based on the outcomes of my assignments. Rather than solely delivering expected outcomes, 
                    I actively contributed to constructing recommendations and strategies, emphasizing the end goal and potential actions to be taken. Additionally, despite the increase in vehicle sales 
                    volume for particular models, I successfully managed and executed a larger quantity of in-vehicle messages (IVMs) which has demonstrates my improved proficiency in managing tasks 
                    amidst increased work demands.

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Enhancing my technological literacy has significantly elevated the quality of my work, through accuracy, thoroughness, and timeliness. My team members have seen a notable improvement 
                    in task completion as I was able to implement advanced Excel operations in the VCS Availability Sheet using automation code, developing code with IF-ELSE statements, etc. Due to these technical enhancements during the internship, 
                    the VCS processes have been substantially optimized compared to before I joined. These improvements have streamlined the use of frameworks and documentations for the entire team and facilitate the next intern's work so it can allow 
                    them to complete their tasks more effectively as well. Additionally, tasks that were previously expected by end-of-day were now consistently accomplished earlier, reflecting my increased efficiency and time management. 
                    My improvement in technological literacy has also allowed for a more proactive approach to completing assignments that has positively impacted the overall workflow and productivity for the entire team.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The conclusion of this internship at Nissan marks the end of an incredible chapter! As my internship at Nissan Canada came to a close, I am extremely grateful for the amazing experience these past 8 months have been. 
                From learning about connected car systems to being part of such an incredible team, it has truly been an awesome journey. I've had the opportunity to dive into various impactful projects, work alongside some of the most 
                talented minds, and gain insights into so much knowledge that I can carry forward in my career.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have had the chance and freedom to learn new technologies and strengthen my skills with those I was already familiar with. Although some of the tools and frameworks I have used was new to me, I ramped myself up 
                and continued to push the scope of my work. If asked to describe the contents of my co-op work term, I see my audience emphasizing the hands-on experience gained in 
                mobile app development process and telematics testing procedures, the practical insights into connected car and vehicle connected services, and effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams to 
                acheive my learning outcomes. Looking forward to the next chapter and am excited to make further contributions to the automotive industry! üöó

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to sincerely thank my VCS Coordinator Roma Bogaczewicz and VCS Development Manager Preston Wong for continuing to encourage me, guide me, and for giving me the opportunity to join the team.
                They have made each day of this internship extremely valuable and has made this experience even more rewarding. Thank you to all team members and fellow colleagues 
                I met along the way who supported me and took an interest in my work!
            <br>  
            <br> 
                I would also like to thank Laura Gatto and Kate McRoberts, my Co-op Coordinators at the University of Guelph, for their invaluable feedback during the co-op application period
                and their patient guidance in addressing my work-term inquiries. A special thank you to my Academic Advisor Greg Klotz for taking the time to read my work term report. I appreciate the 
                amount of time it takes to read through students co-op reports.
            <br>   
            <br>
                I also want to acknowledge that Nissan Canada has been an amazing work environment. The entire team's openness and accessibility have fostered a collaborative 
                atmosphere. The dedication to innovation makes Nissan a truly Great Place To Work! üôå
