                Geotab is a global leader in telematics and connected transportation. Headquartered in Oakville, Ontario, Geotab helps businesses manage their fleets using 
                smart data from tracking vehicle locations in real time to analyzing things like driver behavior and fuel efficiency. What makes Geotab stand out is its open 
                platform which allows companies to plug in different tools and customize their fleet management solutions. With over 3 million connected vehicles around the world, 
                the company is constantly working with massive amounts of data to help businesses make better, safer, and more sustainable decisions. One of the coolest things about 
                working at Geotab is how deeply they care about innovation, data security, and real-world impact. Whether it's improving road safety or reducing carbon footprints, 
                the work being done here is making a difference and it's exciting to be a small part of that during my term.

                Product Team at Geotab plays an role in shaping the tools and systems used across the company and by its partners. The team is made up of product managers, 
                coordinators, designers, and developers who collaborate closely to build and improve internal platforms. One of the main systems I got to work with was MyAdmin which is 
                Geotab's internal portal used by resellers and support teams to manage customer accounts, devices, orders, and more. It's a powerful tool that supports a wide range of 
                day-to-day operations, and being involved in maintaining and enhancing it gave me a great look into how product teams balance user needs, business goals, and technical 
                constraints. It was also a great chance to see how feedback loops and cross-functional collaboration shape the evolution of a product over time.

            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                As a Product Coordinator Intern at Geotab, I had the opportunity to contribute to the Product Team in a hands-on and meaningful way. A major part of 
                my work focused on supporting MyAdmin. One of my 
                most impactful contributions was building an automation solution to streamline the MyAdmin Solutions Request process. Previously manual and time-consuming, 
                this workflow allowed our team to more efficiently collect, prioritize, and route incoming feature and support requests. Automating parts of this process not 
                only saved time but also improved consistency and visibility across teams.

                Another exciting project I worked on involved the use of AI to generate first-draft content for product announcement blogs. By pulling structured data 
                from Jira tickets—like feature summaries, use cases, and release notes, I used Gemini API that produced blog post drafts for the technical writing team. 
                This helped reduce the time spent drafting announcements and gave writers a strong starting point to build from. It was a fun mix of product knowledge, 
                content strategy, and experimentation with AI tools.
            </p>

            <p> 
                This internship has been a huge growth experience for me, both technically and professionally. I improved my project coordination and communication skills by 
                working closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, product managers, and technical writers. Having the chance to explore the practical 
                use of AI in content generation really pushed me to think creatively about how emerging technologies can improve everyday workflows. 

                One of the biggest learning opportunities came early in the term when I was trusted to take on a major feature project from the ground up. I coordinated with multiple 
                stakeholders across product, engineering, and support to gather context, define goals, and kick off the initiative. Leading those initial conversations taught me a lot 
                about stakeholder alignment, project scoping, and setting expectations which are skills that are essential in any product role.

                What really helped me succeed in this role were the concepts I learned in courses like Software Engineering and Software Analysis & Design. These classes gave me a strong 
                foundation in writing user stories, defining acceptance criteria, and understanding the product lifecycle. I was able to apply these skills daily when supporting feature 
                development and documenting new releases. Through it all, I further improved critical soft skills like clear communication, time management, and problem-solving in a 
                fast-paced environment. This internship really showed me how to apply academic knowledge, adapt it, and grow from it.

                <p>
                    I did an excellent job strengthening my oral communication skills during my internship. I consistently provided clear updates in one-on-one meetings with my manager, team check-ins and even in discussions with leadership. One of my biggest 
                    highlights was presenting a section in the August Product Community of Practice meeting, which monthly brings together the entire Product team at Geotab to share innovations and lessons learned. I presented the work I did on automations and 
                    how it can be beneficial across teams as well as how they can implement. I spoke confidently, clearly and kept the audience engaged by asking questions and using the poll feature. Afterward, several people reached out to compliment my presentation 
                    and my mentor even told me it was one of the best presentations he has seen from an intern! This experience showed me how much I've grown in communicating my ideas effectively and confidently in a professional setting.

                    I was able to further strengthen and build on the technological skills. One of my key projects involved working with Unleash Feature Flags. I created webhooks through Unleash to improve how feature flags are managed to ensure they are properly 
                    deprecated on time by auto-creating deprecation tickets assigned to the appropriate dev teams. This made it easier to control which features were active and when they should be removed across multiple environments. Building on this work, I 
                    enhanced my technical skills by going deeper into the implementation process by creating Jira bot notifications and even guided other teams on how to set up and apply these solutions within the MyGeotab system. By doing this, I improved the 
                    efficiency of feature management but also shared my knowledge with others, which gave me valuable experience in both technical problem-solving and cross-team collaboration.

                    I applied critical and creative thinking to analyze repetitive and manual tasks within the MyAdmin team. I successfully implemented 5 automations, utilizing 4 different development tools, freeing 100+ hours to date and projected to save over 40 
                    hours per month. This has enabled the team to focus on higher-priority initiatives and focus on items on the business plan. For example, I worked with the Gemini AI API to integrate with Jira Cloud Automation in order to automate the process of 
                    writing feature updates for the Technical Content Solutions team. This integration allowed us to auto-generate content based on predefined templates which has really streamlined the feature documentation process and making it much more efficient.

                    I leveraged my technical skills to support another team at Geotab by automating the backend of the new Known Issues page which is crucial for communicating issues to partners and customers. I created an Apps Script to format the data in a 
                    specific structure, used Workato automation to upload it to an SFTP server and passed it to a Salesforce automation and scheduled to run daily. Today, the Known Issues page has been a huge success, running smoothly and reliably which 
                    significantly reduces manual work and ensures timely communication. This project showed me how my technical skills can directly support other teams and has added real value to the company.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                My internship at Geotab as a Product Coordinator Intern has really been rewarding experience so far and has allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in real-world settings, take ownership of impactful projects, and grow both personally 
                and professionally. From leading the early development of a key feature in MyAdmin to experimenting with automation and AI-driven content creation, I was able to contribute meaningfully to the Product Team while continuously learning along 
                the way. This work term deepened my understanding of the product lifecycle, strengthened my ability to collaborate across diverse teams, and gave me confidence in navigating ambiguity and complex problem-solving. It also confirmed my passion for 
                product management and I gained a stronger interest in the intersection of technology, user experience, and business strategy while working within the automotive sector.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have had the chance and freedom to learn new technologies and strengthen my skills with those I was already familiar with. Although some of the tools and frameworks I have used was new to me, I ramped myself up 
                and continued to push the scope of my work. If asked to describe the contents of my co-op work term, I would highlight my involvement in impactful product initiatives at Geotab—ranging from leading the development 
                of new MyAdmin features to automating internal processes and leveraging AI for content generation. My website showcases the hands-on experience I gained, the skills I developed, and the real-world impact I was able 
                to make as a Product Coordinator Intern. Looking forward to the next 4 months!

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                A big thank you to Filip, my manager, for trusting me with meaningful work right from the start and always encouraging me to take initiative. I also want to shoutout Glenn, my mentor, who is always there to answer questions, 
                offer feedback, and help me grow throughout the term. Their support made a huge difference in my experience, and I really appreciated the chance to learn from both of them.
            <br>  
            <br> 
                I would also like to thank Laura Gatto, Kate McRoberts, and Anne-Marie Zawadzki, my Co-op Coordinators at the University of Guelph, for their invaluable feedback during the co-op application process
                and their patient guidance in addressing my work-term inquiries. A special thank you to my Academic Advisor Greg Klotz for taking the time to read my work term report. I appreciate the 
                amount of time it takes to read through students co-op reports.
            <br>   
            <br>
                I’d also like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Geotab and the Campus Community Team for creating such a welcoming and growth-focused environment for interns. From day one, I felt like a valued part of the team and the culture made this unforgettable experience, 
                and I’m incredibly grateful to have been part of it.
